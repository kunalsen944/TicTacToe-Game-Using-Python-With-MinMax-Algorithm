                                         Tic-Tac-Toe-Python-With-MinMax-Algorithm
An implementation of Minimax AI Algorithm on Tic-Tac-Toe (or Noughts and Crosses) game

                                          What is Minimax?
Minimax is a artificial intelligence applied in two player games, such as tic-tac-toe, checkers, chess and go. This games are known as 
zero-sum games, because in a mathematical representation: one player wins (+1) and other player loses (-1) or both of anyone not to win (0).

                                          How does it works?
The algorithm search, recursively, the best move that leads the Max player to win or not lose (draw). It consider the current state of the 
game and the available moves at that state, then for each valid move it plays (alternating min and max) until it finds a terminal state 
(win, draw or lose).
